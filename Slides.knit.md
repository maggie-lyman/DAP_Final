# What are ADUs?

  - Basement or attic apartment conversions (granny flats)
  - Coach houses
  
In May 2021, Chicago passed the ADU ordinance to streamline zoning requirements for ADU conversion projects in 5 zones: North, Northwest, West, Southwest, South.

The goal of this program is to increase density and provide additional, affordable and naturally affordable apartments.

# Overview of the ADU Ordinance

  - Streamlines the zoning process: City Council approval is not required to build an ADU
  - Removes some parking requirements, increasing affordability of units
  - Properties with 2 or more ADUs must set each additional ADU at 60% area median income (AMI)
  - Additional requirements for ADUs in South, West, and Southwest zones: Buildings with one to three units must be owner-occupied, only two ADU permits issued per block per year, cannot construct coach houses on vacant lots before a principal residence.

# Our Research Questions

  1. Where are ADUs built in the city? Is there a connection between areas with high rent and areas with more ADUs constructed? 
  2. Where are ADU applications denied?
  3. What kinds of ADUs are built?
  4. What is the public's perception of ADUs?
